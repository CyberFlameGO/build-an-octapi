# Check that it works

- Make sure your dedicated "OctaPi" router is powered on and fully booted up, the **client** is booted with peripherals attached, and the **server** is booted with only a power lead attached.

- Open a terminal on the **client**

    ![Terminal](images/terminal.png)

- Make sure you are in the `/home/pi` directory and type the following command to run the `compute.py` example software provided with the client software examples you downloaded earlier:

    ```bash
    sudo python3 compute.py
    ```
    The `compute.py` Python script runs 15 jobs on your server. They are all just random delays before returning. If the OctaPi is working correctly, the jobs will complete in about a minute and a table showing the statistics for the application will be shown in the terminal.Â You should see a result similar to this:
    
    ```bash
    
                               Node |  CPUs |    Jobs |    Sec/Job | Node Time Sec
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     192.168.1.49 (raspberrypi)     |     4 |       4 |     16.040 |        64.160
    
    Total job time: 223.548 sec, wall time: 20.245 sec, speedup: 11.042
    ```


    If the `compute.py` script does not work, review your steps one by one and check that client, server, and router are all set up correctly and working properly.

- If the test worked, use the client to manually shut down the server (replacing `<remote_ip>` with the IP address of the **server** you noted down earlier):

    ```bash
    ssh <remote_ip>;
    sudo shutdown -HP now
    ```

    You may need to use **nmap** again to find the server IP address if it changed when the Wi-Fi router rebooted.

    In future we will be using the `cluster_action.sh` script to do this.

- Once the server is shut down, remove its micro SD card.

- Using an SD card duplicator or a computer which is able to read SD cards, create seven more identical copies of this SD card and insert them into the other servers so that you have a total of eight.
