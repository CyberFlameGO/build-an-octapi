## What you will need

### Hardware

- 9 x Raspberry Pi 3
- 8 x Unicorn HAT (optional)
- 8 x short Micro USB cables
- Wireless router
- [Power hub](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Universal-professional-charging-2-4amps-simultaneously/dp/B01DZKOUS4/ref=lp_11206805031_1_1?srs=11206805031&ie=UTF8&qid=1488288887&sr=8-1){:target="_blank"}
- Ethernet cable

You need nine Raspberry Pi 3 computers in total, because eight of these will form the OctaPi cluster. Only the final one will need the usual peripherals to act as the client machine.

You may wish to mount your OctaPi cluster on a perspex board with standoffs as shown in the photographs.

We do not recommend using a router which is repurposed from a broadband service provider. Whilst using such a router might work, features may be locked down in the router or set to non-default conditions to suit the service provider's requirements. This could affect its use with the OctaPi.

### Software

The OctaPi will make use of the following software packages. Details for how to install them are provided in the resource.

- Python 3 `dispy`
- Python 3 `nmap`
- Python 3 `psutil`
- Python 3 `unicornhat`
