## OctaPi physical set-up

- Decide how you will power your OctaPi. You could simply power each of the eight Raspberry Pi computers separately using eight standard power supplies, or you may find it more convenient to use a USB hub or charger in order to power them centrally.

 **Note:** It is essential that there is sufficient power to provide 2.4A to each Raspberry Pi 3. Not all USB hubs/chargers can power 2.4A on every port, so make sure to check this carefully.

- If you are using the Unicorn HATs, install a HAT onto the GPIO connector of each of the servers.

- If you wish, you can mount the eight Raspberry Pi 3s onto a backboard. Alternatively, there are cases for multiple Raspberry Pis available for purchase, or you can simply leave them laid out - they will work as a cluster even if they aren't attached to anything.
